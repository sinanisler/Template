A Theme Designed to Give WordPress Users Super Powers ðŸ˜Ž


## WHY

With this theme My aim is to create a setting page to show all the features and options for normal users to get super powers.

if it is possible why not make it?

 

Theme Settings and Features list TBD...

# Notes for me
Since this is going to be a public theme on the wp.org directory I will follow WP and PHP standards.
